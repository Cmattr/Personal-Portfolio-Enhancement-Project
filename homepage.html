            <h2>biography</h2>
            <blockquote>
                I was born in Louisville, KY, on October 5th, 1993. Growing up, I was immersed in the world of technology, as my father was a software engineer. 
                From an early age, I learned the basics of computer science, which sparked my curiosity and interest in the field.
                In 2012, I graduated from Seneca High School and started college at the University of Louisville, where I majored in biology. Despite my major,
                I took a few coding and computer science classes, which reignited my passion for technology.
                Currently, I have just graduated from the Coding Temple Software Engineering Core course. I'm excited to begin my career as a software engineer and develop 
                a wide range of applications.
